# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
Analyzing kickstarter data to reveal trends

By analyzing kickstarter data, we can see that kickstarters in the theatre category are the most popular and most successful compared to other categories (see below image). We can see that of the 1393 theatre kickstarters, 839 of them met their goals by their deadline. ![image]("Parent Category Outcomes.png")

We can also see that within all kickstarter categories, the best time of year to launch the kickstarter is May. If we only look at theatre kickstarters, this holds true, and we can also see that June and July are better than other months as well. ![image]("Outcomes Based on Launch Date.png")

Using this information, I would recommend that Louise launch her theatre kickstarter in May to have the best chance at being successful.
